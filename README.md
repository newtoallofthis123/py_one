# Python One File

Okay, this is an interesting concept I wanted to try out.

Ever get lost while coding and struggle to find a good on the hands reference? Well wouldn't it be so much easier if all you had to do was open a file.

This is the idea behind **py_one_file.py**

## This contains

- variables

- conditional statements

- simple functions

- lists

- dictonaries

- tuple

- classes

## Contributing

You can easily contribute to this project.

If you want to add a concept, just write it in the file with proper naming and proper comments

If you want to introduce a seperate concept, like flask or django, please free to [contact me](mailto:noobscience@duck.com).
